This project is a blog. 
Main page is a list of full blog posts, not paginated.
Users can write and submit blog posts for approval, including images (could-have). Will the assessor need to see their submitted and unapproved posts, or should I auto-approve everything?
All images are could-have.
Administrator can create, change, delete blog post.
Administrator can approve submitted blog posts.

That is it. Very simple.

So...


~~~

I need to figure out how to do that main page.

I need to figure out the admin creating and deleting posts.

~~~

The main page:

the most basic html possible

code (js?) to create each post(?)

THAT IS IT!!

~~~

main page html:

header placeholder text
main placeholder text
footer placeholder text


~~~

model:
title/, article_body/, writer/, date written/, approved/, slug/, updated on/, blurb/, order/

~~

a page (or part of a page due to extending base.html, etc) that displays articles(aka posts):

in Codestar, in blog.views.py, there is a class that runs a django function that returns a list of posts. then the index.html template loops through 
it and  basically displays attributes of each item in the list.

do i need to mess with statics for this to work?

30/10: things I need to do still

IN THE CODE:
    -accessibility: aria-labels, contrast checks, and check if there is anything else for accessibility/
    -make sure the superuser approval system works/
    -Make the links in the header work /
    -make sure you can only edit and delete your own articles: either have them not appear or block them working/
    -delete test data and test users/
    -make sure the content is ok/
    -stop the article titles being links (they get the finger, change colour, etc) /
    -add a heading explaining the site at the top of articles list /
    -add explainer to top of my subs/
    -look at the posts, users in admin/
    -have something on the my subs articles saying both is-draft and is-awaiting-approval /
-something about tidying up the code (comments, readability?) see LO 1.4
    -harmonize the colours of the buttons/
    -notification messages of data changes - see LO 2.3 /                
    -form validation - LO 2.4 /
    -access control LO 3.3 /
-write or get AI to write tests in python, maybe also JS - LO 4.1-4.3 - quickly skim the LMS content again on this first.
    -my subs displays articles side by side, it shouldnt/
-turn off debug
    -decide on a name for the site and put that in the header and title/
    -page titles need to be proper titles/   
    -put up arrow in the edit and delete buttons/
    -a decent space at the bottom of each article to show what the buttons apply to./
    -see CSS line 33 - empty ruleset - can I delete? do at end /
    -make sure it displays right on all device sizes /
    -sort out header and footer/ 
    -register page not formatted/
-Ensure the final committed code is free of passwords or security-sensitive information before deployment to the repository and hosting platform.

OUTSIDE THE CODE:
    -write in readme about ux design: /
    -    finish wireframes, save screenshots of them in the appropriate folder/
    -do user stories /
    -write in readme about agile(user stories)/
-   add could haves
-write about testing - LO  4.3
    -do I need to write about GIT's use? check nothing sensitive is on Git - LO 5.1-5.2/
-(See below as well) write about deploying to heroku - LO 6.2
-deploy to heroku, make sure it works the same - LO 6.1-6.3 
    -write in readme about AI - LO 8.1-8.4 //                           
- put all headings in readme /~                                                           
-do i need to spellcheck?
-check what I wrote in readme against the relevant LO's
-check everything against the LO's
-look at example projects
-write about the accessibility if I haven't already
-format readme properly

COULD DO:
-Could do: hero banner thing
-Could do: change sizes of edit and delete buttons
