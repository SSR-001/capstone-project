This project is a blog. 
Main page is a list of full blog posts, not paginated.
Users can write and submit blog posts for approval, including images (could-have). Will the assessor need to see their submitted and unapproved posts, or should I auto-approve everything?
All images are could-have.
Administrator can create, change, delete blog post.
Administrator can approve submitted blog posts.

That is it. Very simple.

So...

I need to figure out how to do that main page.

I need to figure out the admin creating and deleting posts.

The main page:

the most basic html possible

code (js?) to create each post(?)

THAT IS IT!!

main page html:

header placeholder text
main placeholder text
footer placeholder text
